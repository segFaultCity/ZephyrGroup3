# SQL Database:
- At first, our group was unsure on whether or not we would incorporate a database. With further discussion, we realized it would be a smooth process to run a user interface via an ec2 linux instance that is linked to an AWS database. This way we can keep track of user information and make simple GET request from our Zephyr app and run the alarm.  
- The Following link displays the tables created for Use Case 1 that we implemented (Infant Routines).

# Zephyr Code:

- IMPORTANT: This code must be in the VM to run. Our group has a download for a working VM that's prebuilt for users. Get the VM and learn how to run the code here:
