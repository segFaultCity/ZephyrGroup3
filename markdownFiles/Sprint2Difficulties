##Difficulties In Sprint2 

1. As it currently stands, the code only runs with networking in posix (linux). 
  * In affect the code acts the same in posix mode as it would on a Zephyr box.
  * We feel this is mostly due to the QEMU emulator and can be resolved in later sprints with more investigation. 
  * In attempt to fix this, Ben went in to professor Goggins' office hours several times as well as talking with other groups. 
2. We would like to also like to add security features for the zephyr machine.
