# Final Target System 

Our final system will allow the end user to execute three types of reminders (use cases) on their zephyr box by inputing their information on the Remind O' Clock website.
## Use cases
1.  Infant Routines
  - Sets off a reminder for the parents to remind them to fulfil a routine for their infant.
2.  Daily Schedule
  - Sets off an alarm at a certain time every day.
3.  Random Reminders 
  - Set an alarm for non regular events in a users schedule.
