# Final Target System 

Our final system will allow the end user to execute three types of reminders (use cases) and alarm types on their zephyr box by inputing their information on the Remind O' Clock website.  
### Use cases / Types of Reminders
1.  Infant Routines  
    - Sets off a reminder for the parents to remind them to fulfil a routine for their infant.
2.  Daily Schedule  
    - Sets off an alarm at a certain time every day.
3.  Random Reminders   
    - Sets an alarm for a non regular event in a users schedule.
    
This Reminder system is the one stop shop for all alarms needed by a particular user and is made easily accessible for home use through our system.
